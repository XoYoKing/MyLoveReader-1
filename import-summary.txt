ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .idea/
* .idea/.name
* .idea/LoveReader6.0.iml
* .idea/compiler.xml
* .idea/copyright/
* .idea/copyright/profiles_settings.xml
* .idea/misc.xml
* .idea/modules.xml
* .idea/vcs.xml
* .idea/workspace.xml
* proguard.cfg

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* libs/activation.jar => app/libs/activation.jar
* libs/additionnal.jar => app/libs/additionnal.jar
* libs/armeabi/libmupdf.so => app/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi/libmupdf.so
* libs/itextpdf-5.4.1.jar => app/libs/itextpdf-5.4.1.jar
* libs/jxl.jar => app/libs/jxl.jar
* libs/mail.jar => app/libs/mail.jar
* libs/poi-3.7-20101029.jar => app/libs/poi-3.7-20101029.jar
* libs/poi-scratchpad-3.7-20101029.jar => app/libs/poi-scratchpad-3.7-20101029.jar
* res/ => app/src/main/res/
* src/ => app/src/main/java/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
